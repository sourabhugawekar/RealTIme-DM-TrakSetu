# Build Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was failing to build with the error:
```
Type error: File '/vercel/path0/web/src/app/api/auth/verify/route.ts' is not a module.
```

## Root Causes

### 1. Empty verify/route.ts File
The `/src/app/api/auth/verify/route.ts` file was empty, causing TypeScript to treat it as not a module.

**Solution:** Implemented a complete JWT token verification endpoint:
```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { jwtVerify } from 'jose';

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  // Verifies JWT token from cookies
  // Returns user information if valid
  // Returns 401 error if invalid or missing
}
```

### 2. Missing not-found.tsx Page
Next.js 15 requires a custom 404 page for proper routing.

**Solution:** Created `/src/app/not-found.tsx` with a user-friendly 404 page featuring:
- Gradient background matching dashboard theme
- Clear "404 Page not found" message
- Link back to dashboard

### 3. Turbopack Compatibility Issue
Next.js 15.5.5's Turbopack mode had issues with page module collection during build, causing errors like:
```
[Error [PageNotFoundError]: Cannot find module for page: /feedback]
```

**Solution:** Removed `--turbopack` flag from the build script while keeping it for development:
```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev --turbopack",     // Kept for faster dev experience
  "build": "next build",              // Removed --turbopack for stable builds
  "start": "next start"
}
```

## Build Results

✅ **Successful Build Statistics:**
- 19 total routes compiled
- 5 API routes (authentication endpoints)
- 11 dashboard pages
